Musicals are a fun way to tell a multitude of tales, whether they be on the screen or stage.  Some people think the singing and dancing is a little excesive, but I think these can be used to convey emotions in a way no other art form can.  I love listening to music, so the idea of using it to tell a story is one that ressonates with me.  Some of my favourite musicals include The Lion King, Hamilton, and Come From Away.

Originally an animated film from Disney Animation, The Lion King went on to be a huge franchise with sequels, TV shows, a remake, and a stage musical.  The story that started it all follows Simba, a young lion who is the son of Mufasa, king of the Pride Lands.  After Mufasa is killed by Scar, the king's evil brother, Simba runs away into exile, where he is raised by Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the warthog.  As he grows up, though, he comes to realize his destiny in the Circle of Life.  With an epic story, lovable characters, vibrant animation, and iconic songs courtesy of Elton John and Tim Rice, The Lion King is one of my favourite movies of all time.

Hamilton is a stage musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda that tells the story of the American Revolution from the perspective of Alexander Hamilton and his family.  Notable for its sung-through hip-hop style and colourblind casting, this musical became an instant hit with theatre fans.  I first watched this musical through the proshot on Disney+, and then saw it live in Toronto, and I absolutely believe the hype.  The songs in particular are true standouts, with Miranda's signature clever rhymes and the beautiful mix of old and new music styles.

Come From Away is a stage musical by Irene Sankoff and David Hein.  It tells the true story of how the people of Gander, Newfoundland responded to the redirection of 38 planes to their town in the wake of 9/11.  For a while, I had only been aware of the opening song of this musical.  However, when I saw this musical at the Thunder Bay Auditorium.  I was blown away by how good it was.  The music had these folk vibes which I really loved, and the characters ranged from charming to tragic in all the best ways.  The message of hosptiality and togetherness had an emotional impact as well.  Honestly, though, one of my favourite things about the musical were the references to Canadian culture like Tim Hortons and Shoppers Drug Mart.  I found it cool how these things that were imbeded in my life were being represented in a stage show!
